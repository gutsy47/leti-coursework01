# LETI university. C++ course work

### About
This project represents all the practices I've done this #1 semester. 
Descriptions and reports are in the practice_0N repositories

### Build
All the headers with their source files are in /modules/. Executable is: main.cpp

### How it works
At its core, this is just a shortcut menu to all practical. 
You'll see the list of modules on start. Exit from module just returns you to the main menu.
